## How to get your PR merged quickly

* Read my guide, ["How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall in Love with You,"](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/) to understand how to contribute effectively to an open source project.
* Give a clear, one-line title to your PR.
  * Good: `Fix dropped keystrokes on Firefox`
  * Bad: `Fix issue`
* If your PR is not ready for review, mark it as "draft."
* [Rebase your changes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase) onto the latest `master` commit so that there are no merge conflicts.
* Your PR must pass build checks in CI before it will be considered for merge.
  * You'll see a green checkmark or red X next to your PR depending on whether your build passed or failed.
  * You are responsible for fixing formatting and tests to ensure that your code passes build checks in CI.

I try to review all PRs within one business day. If you've been waiting longer than this, feel free to comment on the PR to verify that it's on my radar.
